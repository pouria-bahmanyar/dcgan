# Convolutional GAN
In this project I used a convolutional network (CNN) to train Generator to produce Images of human face. 
I used `WGAN` loss function to make a better result
the dataset which I used is `CelebA` consisting almost 200K images of face.
the output of generator during training for 20 epochs is as bellow:
